                This visualization presents the relationships between the 
                various socio-political entities involved in Syria during the Syrian civil war. 
                The dynamics of the various forces at play during this time is quite difficult 
                for even dedicated followers to keep track of and this visualization provides 
                a comprehensive look at that.

                <b>Description</b>
            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
                The visualization puts forward a relationship matrix using a symbol 
                value to signify the relationship between the two entities which intersect at 
                that point. 
                <br><br>
                The visualization is interactive and the viewer can click on the symbols to get more information about 
                that specific relationship (Fig 2).
                <br><br>
                The choice of color used for the icons, red, green and yellow are quite useful for the purpose of 
                instantly conveying the relationship status. Viewers will automatically associate red with danger, 
                green with stable conditions and yellow with the middle ground thus not requiring further explanation 
                of what the symbols mean. The interaction in this visualization is that on clicking one of the relationship 
                icons, a popup provides further data on the relationship. Also, on hovering on an icon, 
                the connected organiations are highlighted. The click action interaction makes sure that there is sufficient 
                data abstraction at a first glance, but more date can be gathered by exploring the figure. The hover action 
                helps users track what exactly they are looking for.
                <br><br>
                I think this is a good visualization because it effectively summarizes the information, makes it memorable 
                and easy to explore. Without visualization, this sort of non-numeric data would have to be written down in 
                several paragraphs and that would leave the reader with the responsibility of forming all the connections 
                in their minds. This visualization makes the data available at a glance and even provides the option to 
                allow the users to learn more about a specific relationship that they may be interested in.
